A Version Control System (VCS) is a tool that helps manage changes to documents, programs, and other information stored as computer files. It allows multiple people to work on a project simultaneously, tracks every individual change by each contributor, and enables the merging of changes in a controlled and systematic manner.


There are two main types of version control systems: centralized and distributed.
Centralized Version Control System (CVCS)
In a CVCS, all the versioned files are stored on a central server. Contributors check out files from this central place, make changes, and then commit their changes back to the central server. Examples include Subversion (SVN) and Perforce. The main drawback of centralized systems is their single point of failure; if the central server goes down, no one can collaborate or save versioned changes.

Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)
DVCS, such as Git and Mercurial, allows each contributor to have a full copy of the entire repository, including its history, on their local machine. Changes are made locally and then pushed to one or more central repositories. This model offers several advantages, including enhanced collaboration, greater speed, and the ability to work offline. It also provides robustness against the failure of a single repository.



Key Features of VCS
Change Tracking: Every change made to files in a repository is tracked, allowing users to see who made changes, what changes were made, and when they were made.
Branching and Merging: Users can create branches to experiment with new features or ideas in a separate area from the main project, then merge those changes back when they're ready.
Collaboration: Team members can work on different parts of a project simultaneously without interfering with each other's work.
History and Audit: The full history of changes to the project is stored, enabling audit trails, analysis, and reverting to previous states if necessary.
